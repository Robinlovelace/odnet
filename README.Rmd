# Introduction

Origin-destination (OD) datasets are used to represents movement through geographic space, from an origin (O) to a destination (D).
Also referred to as 'flow data'^[https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2011census/2011censusdata/originanddestinationdata] OD datasets usually contain not only information about where they start or end, but also about the amount of movement between zones (which are often represented by a zone centroid) or other geographic entities.
Because of their ability to encode a large amount of information about millions of trips in a relatively small amount of storage space, with the maximum number of rows in an aggregate OD dataset equal to square of the number of zones squared, including intra-zonal OD pairs.
Thus, the entire transport system of London can be represented, albeit simplistically, as an OD dataset representing movement between the city's 33 boroughs with only 33^2 (1089) rows and a number of columns depending on the number of trip types.

Because of these easy-to-use characteristics, OD datasets have long been used to describe aggregate urban mobility patterns [@carey_method_1981].
Typically, OD datasets are represented *geographically* as straight 'desire lines' between zone centroids, with all trips shown as departing from and arriving to a single centroid per zone, for convenience, simplicity and (historically) to reduce computational requirements.
This approach, illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:od1) below, has formed the basis of many visualisations and research projects using OD data [e.g. @rae_spatial_2009; @calabrese_estimating_2011].

```{r od1, fig.cap="Illustration of typicall representation of OD dataset, illustrating travel to work patterns in England. Source: author's [analysis](https://github.com/creds2/od-data) of open access data from the 2011 Census.", out.width="80%"}

# file.copy("~/orgs/creds2/od-data/overview_map1.png", ".")

knitr::include_graphics("overview_map1.png")
```

Connecting zones with straight lines in this way has advantages: it can provide a quick summary of the movement patterns between zones, particularly when attributes such as total number of trips and the percentage of trips made by a particular mode are represented by variable aesthetics such as line width and colour, as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:od1).

However, the approach has limitations, including:

1. people do not travel in straight lines!
2. centroid-based desire lines obscure two-way flows [@tennekes_design_2021]
3. incorrect concentration of travel around certain points

One way to add richness and realism to OD data is to convert the geographic desire lines into routes on the network and then aggregate the associated data to the route segment level to create route network outputs [@morgan_travel_2020].
Route network generation from centroid-based desire lines addresses limitations 1 and 2 outlined above, but not 3.
In this paper we explore the potential for different 'jittering' and disaggregation approaches to address limitations 1 to 3.
Unlike some previous methodological papers on OD data, we are not only concerned with the visualisation of the data.
The aim is to not only create informative visualisations but also to generate accurate results, measured as a correlation between estimated flow on the network from the route network results and real world datasets, and valuable open access datasets for subsequent geographic analysis steps.

# Data and methods

The geographic input datasets on which the analysis presented in this paper build are cleaned versions of open datasets representing the transport system in Edinburgh (see Figure \@ref(fig:overview)):

- Open access cycle counter data, stored in [`cycle_counts_edinburgh_summary_2020-03-02-2022-01-05.geojson`](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/odnet/releases/download/0/cycle_counts_edinburgh_summary_2020-03-02-2022-01-05.geojson)
- Open zones data, stored in [`iz_zones11_ed`](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/od/releases/download/v0.3.1/iz_zones11_ed.geojson)
- Open road network data from OSM, stored as [`road_network_ed.geojson`](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/odnet/releases/download/0/cycle_counts_edinburgh_summary_2020-03-02-2022-01-05.geojson)

A non-geographic OD dataset representing trips between the zones was also generated and saved as a [.csv file](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/od/releases/download/v0.3.1/od_iz_ed.csv), the first three elements of which are presented in the table below.

```{r}
# download data
if(!file.exists("https://github.com/Robinlovelace/odnet/releases/download/0/cycle_counts_edinburgh_summary_2020-03-02-2022-01-05.geojson")) {
system("wget https://github.com/Robinlovelace/odnet/releases/download/0/cycle_counts_edinburgh_summary_2020-03-02-2022-01-05.geojson")
system("wget https://github.com/ITSLeeds/od/releases/download/v0.3.1/od_iz_ed.csv")
system("wget https://github.com/ITSLeeds/od/releases/download/v0.3.1/iz_zones11_ed.geojson")
system("wget https://github.com/Robinlovelace/odnet/releases/download/0/road_network_ed.geojson")
}
```



```{r}
counters = sf::read_sf("https://github.com/Robinlovelace/odnet/releases/download/0/cycle_counts_edinburgh_summary_2020-03-02-2022-01-05.geojson")
od = readr::read_csv("https://github.com/ITSLeeds/od/releases/download/v0.3.1/od_iz_ed.csv")
zones = sf::read_sf("https://github.com/ITSLeeds/od/releases/download/v0.3.1/iz_zones11_ed.geojson")
centroids = sf::read_sf("https://github.com/ITSLeeds/od/releases/download/v0.3.1/iz_centroids11_ed.geojson")
network = sf::read_sf("network.geojson")
desire_lines = od::od_to_sf(od, zones)
# sf::write_sf(road_network, "road_network_ed.geojson")
# piggyback::pb_upload("road_network_ed.geojson")
```

```{r}
od %>% 
  slice(1:3) %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "Sample of three rows from the OD dataset used in this paper.")
```


```{r overview, fig.cap="Overview of the study area and the input geographic datasets. Dot size is proportional to mean cycle count at counter locations."}
tm_shape(zones) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_shape(road_network %>% sample_n(1000)) +
  tm_lines(col = "red", lwd = 0.2) +
  tm_shape(counters, size = 2) +
  tm_dots(size = "mean_count", size.lim = c(100, 1000))
```

To test the performance of different parameters and settings for the OD-to-route-network conversion process, we focussed only on cycling trips as these were measured in the counter dataset mentioned.
The following parameters were adjusted to explore their importance, in roughly descending order of frequency of mentions in the literature:

1. The routing profile used, which can 'prefer' differet route types, resulting in 'quiet' to 'fast' networks [@desjardins_correlates_2021]
2. The level of disaggregation, ranging from none to full disaggregation (on desire line and route per trip) [@jafari_investigation_2015]
3. Jittering strategy used to sample origin and destination points within zones [@lovelace_jittering_2022] 

<!-- To run algorithm you need a minimum of three inputs, examples of which are provided in the `data/` folder of this repo: -->

<!-- 1. A .csv file containing OD data with two columns containing zone IDs (specified with  `--origin-key=geo_code1 --destination-key=geo_code2` by default) and other columns representing trip counts: -->
<!-- ```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE} -->
<!-- od = readr::read_csv("data/od.csv") -->
<!-- knitr::kable(od[1:3, ]) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- 2. A [.geojson file](https://github.com/dabreegster/odjitter/blob/main/data/zones.geojson) representing zones that contains values matching the zone IDs in the OD data (the field containing zone IDs is specified with `--zone-name-key=InterZone` by default): -->
<!-- ```{r, echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- # zones = sf::read_sf("data/zones.geojson") -->
<!-- # zones[1:3, ] -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ```{bash} -->
<!-- head -6 data/zones.geojson -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- 3. A [.geojson file](https://github.com/dabreegster/odjitter/blob/main/data/road_network.geojson) representing a transport network from which origin and destination points are sampled -->
<!-- ```{bash} -->
<!-- head -6 data/road_network.geojson -->
<!-- ``` -->

The jittering process was undertaken with the Rust crate `odjitter`, which can be replicated using the following reproducible code run from a system terminal such as Bash on Linux, PowerShell on Windows or the Mac Terminal ([Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) must be installed for this to work).

First install the `odjitter` Rust crate and command line tool:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/dabreegster/odjitter
```

Generate jittered OD pairs with a `max-per-od` value of 50 as follows:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
odjitter --od-csv-path od_iz_ed.csv \
  --zones-path iz_zones11_ed.geojson \
  --subpoints-path road_network_ed.geojson \
  --max-per-od 50 --output-path output_max50.geojson
```

Try running it with a different `max-per-od` value (10 in the command below):

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
odjitter --od-csv-path od_iz_ed.csv \
  --zones-path iz_zones11_ed.geojson \
  --subpoints-path road_network_ed.geojson \
  --max-per-od 10 --output-path output_max50.geojson
```

```{r}
desire_lines = od::od_to_sf(od, zones)
sum(desire_lines$bicycle > 0) # 3367 
desire_lines_top = desire_lines %>% 
  top_n(n = 500, wt = bicycle)
# write_csv(desire_lines_top %>% sf::st_drop_geometry(), "od_top.csv")
# piggyback::pb_upload("od_top.csv")
```


Generate results for top 500, run once:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
odjitter --od-csv-path od_top.csv \
  --zones-path iz_zones11_ed.geojson \
  --subpoints-path road_network_ed.geojson \
  --max-per-od 1000 --output-path output_max10k.geojson
odjitter --od-csv-path od_top.csv \
  --zones-path iz_zones11_ed.geojson \
  --subpoints-path road_network_ed.geojson \
  --max-per-od 50 --output-path output_max50.geojson
odjitter --od-csv-path od_top.csv \
  --zones-path iz_zones11_ed.geojson \
  --subpoints-path road_network_ed.geojson \
  --max-per-od 10 --output-path output_max10.geojson
```
