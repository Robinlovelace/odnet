<!-- % **************  MAIN BODY OF THE PAPER ************** -->
Introduction to guidelines
==========================

The purpose of providing these notes is to standardise the format of the
short papers submitted to GISRUK 2022. These notes are based on author
guidelines previously produced for the GISRUK conference series which in
turn were based on other guidelines.

The pages should have margins of 2.5 cm all round. The base font should
be Times New Roman 11pt, or closest equivalent and text should be single
spaced. Each section of the paper should be numbered. Section headings
should be left-justified and given in bold type. A slightly larger font
should be used for the title of the paper and the authors (16pt and 14pt
respectively). The first line of each paragraph in each section should
**NOT** be indented.

Sub-sections
------------

Sub-sections should also be numbered as shown here. The sub-section
heading should be left-justified and given in bold type (11pt).

Figures, Tables and Equations,
==============================

Equations should be centred on the page and numbered consecutively in
the right-hand margin, as below. They should be referred to in the text
as Equation [\[first_equation\]](#first_equation){reference-type="ref"
reference="first_equation"}.

$$E=mc^2
\label{first_equation}$$

Figures should be presented as an integral part of the paper and should
be referred to as
Figure [\[first_figure\]](#first_figure){reference-type="ref"
reference="first_figure"} in the text.
